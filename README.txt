Acts as a very simple command line interpreter.  It reads commands from 
standard input entered from the terminal and executes them. The shell does
not include any provisions for control structures, pipes, redirection, 
background processes, environmental variables, or other advanced properties
of a modern shell. All commands are implemented internally and do not rely
on external system programs.
